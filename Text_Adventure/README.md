# Module5_CPlusPlus

# Overview
This software was written to show how to implement variables, expressions, conditionals, and loops in a C++ program.

This program will walk the user through a choose-yout-own-adventure style of story telling.
The computer will pose a series of options for the user and will tell the whole story at the end of the program.
